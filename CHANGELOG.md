## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `CLAUDE.md` — guidance for Claude Code agents working in this repo.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — this file.
- `.github/` issue + PR templates.
- **Schema v0.2** (#1): `SoulStore` now creates three additional tables alongside `soul_state` —
  `events` (full `PhysicsTick` history), `config_overrides` (live-tunable knobs), and
  `pulse_log` (every `PulseEngine` evaluation). Composite `(agent_id, ts DESC)` indexes on
  `events` and `pulse_log` for fast UI queries. Schema is created idempotently and upgrades
  v0.1 databases (which only had `soul_state`) in place without data loss.
- `SoulStore.connection` and `SoulStore.lock` properties so sibling modules can share the
  same SQLite connection and write lock (avoids second-handle contention).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- Initial extraction from CARL.
- Three-layer VADUGWI runtime: `Score` (conversational), `EmotionalPhysics` (mood),
  `SoulState` + `SoulStore` (persistent baseline).
- `TraumaReservoir` and `NourishmentReservoir` with 14-day half-life.
- Host-agnostic `PulseEngine` driven by a `PulseHost` protocol.
- Test suite covering physics, soul, score, and pulse triggers.
